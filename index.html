      <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        As I reflect on the past semester in the General Studies course, I realize how much I have grown both academically and personally. This class has provided me with the opportunity to explore various topics that have enhanced my critical thinking, communication skills, and overall awareness of the world around me.
      </p>

      <h2>Initial Thoughts on Class and Program</h2>
      <p>
        When I first started this program, I was unsure of what to expect. The structure of the General Studies course was unfamiliar to me, but I quickly adapted. I found the class to be engaging and the content relevant to real-life experiences. The interactive lectures and group discussions allowed me to connect with my classmates and learn from different perspectives.

      <h2>Challenges Encountered</h2>
      <p>
        One of the major challenges I faced during this semester was time management. Balancing schoolwork with personal responsibilities proved to be difficult at times. Additionally, I struggled with participating actively in class discussions initially due to my introverted nature. However, through encouragement from the lecturer and peers, I gradually became more confident in sharing my thoughts.
      </p>

      <h2>Plans for Future Improvement</h2>
      <p>
        Moving forward, I plan to improve my time management by using a planner to organize my tasks and setting realistic goals. I also intend to continue building my confidence by participating more actively in class and seeking help whenever I face challenges. I believe that with these strategies in place, I will be better equipped to handle future academic responsibilities.
